<h1>Virtualization</h1>
In computing, <b>virtualization</b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.
<hr>
<h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</li>
<br>
Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. <br>
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.

	<li>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</li>
<br>
In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
<br>
</ol>
<il> In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.
</il>
<il> So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.
